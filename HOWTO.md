Yes, absolutely. That is an excellent and insightful question. Using a separate, dedicated Terraform script to provision the backend infrastructure is a more advanced and robust pattern.

This approach is often called the **"Bootstrap" or "Management" Configuration**. You are essentially using Terraform to manage the resources that Terraform itself depends on.

Let's break down how this works and why it's a great idea.

### The Concept: The Two-Project Model

Instead of a one-off bash script, you create a completely separate, small Terraform project whose only job is to create and manage the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for the main project's remote state.

Your directory structure would look like this:

```
├── 1-terraform-backend-setup/  <-- YOUR "PERSONAL" TF SCRIPT
│   ├── main.tf
│   ├── outputs.tf
│   └── providers.tf
│
└── 2-data-move-project/        <-- YOUR MAIN APPLICATION PROJECT
    ├── main.tf
    ├── modules/
    ├── outputs.tf
    ├── providers.tf
    └── variables.tf
```

### Why This is a Superior Approach

*   **Infrastructure as Code:** Your backend infrastructure is no longer a result of a manual, imperative script. It is now defined declaratively, just like the rest of your application. This is the core principle of IaC.
*   **Repeatable and Consistent:** Need to set up a new environment (e.g., for `staging` or `production`)? You can just run your bootstrap Terraform configuration with a different variable (e.g., `terraform apply -var="environment=stg"`) to create a completely separate and consistent set of backend resources.
*   **Auditable and Version Controlled:** The definition of your backend (S3 bucket name, encryption settings, etc.) is now stored in Git. Every change is tracked.
*   **Easier to Manage:** Want to add a KMS key for extra encryption on your state file bucket? Or add specific lifecycle policies? You can easily add those resources to your bootstrap project.

### How to Implement This: A Step-by-Step Guide

Here is the code for your new `1-terraform-backend-setup` project.

#### Step 1: Create the Bootstrap Project Files

Inside the `1-terraform-backend-setup` directory:

**`providers.tf`**
This configuration will use the default **local backend**, because it's the foundational "first" project. Its state file will be local, which is acceptable because you will run this project very infrequently.

```terraform
# File: 1-terraform-backend-setup/providers.tf

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"
}
```

**`main.tf`**
This defines the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table.

```terraform
# File: 1-terraform-backend-setup/main.tf

variable "project_name" {
  description = "The root name for the backend resources."
  type        = string
  default     = "data-move"
}

# The S3 bucket to store the terraform.tfstate file
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "terraform_state" {
  # Bucket names must be globally unique, so we add a random suffix.
  bucket = "${var.project_name}-tf-state-${random_id.suffix.hex}"
}

# Enable versioning on the S3 bucket as a safety measure
resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "terraform_state_versioning" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.terraform_state.id
  versioning_configuration {
    status = "Enabled"
  }
}

# The DynamoDB table for state locking to prevent concurrent runs
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "terraform_lock" {
  name         = "${var.project_name}-tf-lock"
  billing_mode = "PAY_PER_REQUEST" # Simplest and often cheapest for this use case
  hash_key     = "LockID"

  attribute {
    name = "LockID"
    type = "S" # S for String
  }
}

# A helper to ensure a unique bucket name
resource "random_id" "suffix" {
  byte_length = 4
}
```

**`outputs.tf`**
This is crucial. It will print the names of the created resources so you know what to put in your main project's backend configuration.

```terraform
# File: 1-terraform-backend-setup/outputs.tf

output "s3_bucket_for_terraform_state" {
  description = "The name of the S3 bucket created for Terraform state."
  value       = aws_s3_bucket.terraform_state.id
}

output "dynamodb_table_for_terraform_lock" {
  description = "The name of the DynamoDB table for state locking."
  value       = aws_dynamodb_table.terraform_lock.name
}
```

#### Step 2: The Workflow

1.  **Navigate to the bootstrap directory:**
    ```bash
    cd 1-terraform-backend-setup
    ```

2.  **Initialize this project:**
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

3.  **Apply the configuration:**
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

4.  **Review the output.** Terraform will create the resources and then print the output values. It will look something like this:

    ```plaintext
    Apply complete! Resources: 4 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

    Outputs:

    dynamodb_table_for_terraform_lock = "data-move-tf-lock"
    s3_bucket_for_terraform_state = "data-move-tf-state-a1b2c3d4"
    ```

#### Step 3: Update Your Main Project (`2-data-move-project`)

Now you take the values from the output above and use them to configure the backend in your main application project.

In `2-data-move-project/providers.tf`, you would use those exact names:

```terraform
# File: 2-data-move-project/providers.tf

terraform {
  # ... required_providers ...

  # Use the resources created by the bootstrap project
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "data-move-tf-state-a1b2c3d4" # <-- Value from the bootstrap output
    key            = "data-move/dev/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "eu-west-2"
    dynamodb_table = "data-move-tf-lock"            # <-- Value from the bootstrap output
    encrypt        = true
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}
```

You now have a fully automated, version-controlled, and repeatable process for managing the infrastructure that your main project relies on. This is a much more robust and professional setup than using a manual bash script.
